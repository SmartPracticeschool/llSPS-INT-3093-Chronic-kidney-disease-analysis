                            Data Pre-Processing


 Data pre-processing is a process of cleaning the raw data i.e. the data is collected in the real world and is converted to a clean data set. In other words, whenever the data is gathered from different sources it is collected in a raw format and this data isn’t feasible for the analysis. 

Therefore, certain steps are executed to convert the data into a small clean data set, this part of the process is called as data pre-processing 

Follow the following steps to process your Data
  Import the Libraries
  Importing the dataset 
  Taking care of Missing Data 
  Label encoding 
  One Hot Encoding
  Feature Scaling
  Splitting Data into Train and Test
